# As denoted on the timetable, Teams are expected to provide each week, on Friday (but certainly no later than Sunday evening), the following documents:

    A set of Minutes for each Team meeting held that week (PDF or MS-Word doc),
    A time-sheet summarising the work that has gone on that week (Spreadsheet) based on Booked_hours spreadsheets from Team members, and
    A tar or zip file containing the Booked_hours spreadsheet submitted by EACH Team member. 

(Minutes, TimeSheets and the Booked Hours will be discussed in the Introduction lecture. Also see note on the Project Timetable page. The Project page has templates for the Timesheets, Minutes and Booked Hours.)

The three items are to be emailed to the Project Auditors directly with a copy of each to be deposited in your Team's OneDrive directory. Please observe the file naming convention mentioned on the Project page. 

You are expected to log every contribution to the project on GitHub. That is, not just your contributions to project code, but also all documentation and testing logs.

Keep a record of the time spent on the project each week in your own Booked Hours spreadsheet, and send your data to the Project Manager at the end of the week, so the data can be added to the Team's time-sheet. The time-sheet and a zip or tar file of the Booked Hours spreadsheet will be sent to the Project Supervisor, and will form part of your assessment. Do include all the time spent on the project (to the nearest quarter hour), including formal meetings, but don't pad, as the claimed hours will be calibrated against the outputs that have been uploaded to GitHub.
